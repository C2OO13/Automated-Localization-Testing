Problem Statement : AUTOMATE LOCALIZATION TESTING

•Develop an Automation Testing Framework using any of the Automation Tools like Selenium, Cypress etc. to automate regression testing across different cultures.
•Test Scripts and Commands should be required to be written only once irrespective of the culture; but the framework should have the capability to automatically pick and match the correct strings as per the culture to decide the test case result.
•Generate a report(html/text file) with success/fail status for all test cases executed
